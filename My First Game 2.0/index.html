<h2>ASTEROIDS!!!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Asteroids are headed towards Earth unless you can stop them!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I chose the "asteroid heading toward Earth" theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
The input is through the left mouse click. Randomness is where the asteroids spawn and where they move towards. They also have a random amount of "health". This is a fast paced action game where mouse speed is key.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want my players to have a heart-racing experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can only left click with the mouse on the asteroids to destroy them. If you click on an asteroid enough times, it will blow up. I was not able to get the asteroids to actually collide with the Earth so there is no lose condition.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype tests the point and click game mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The asteroids have a random amount of "health" and then spawn/move in random directions. When an asteroid spawns, the screen shakes and you can hear rumbling.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
My game takes place right outside Earth's atmosphere. The only player is the person playing the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The story of the game is that a nearby planet exploded and sent debris and "asteroids" in all directions, endangering the inhabitants of Earth.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Young children who want to play an easy game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Any amount of time, there is no end.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The best strategy is to click as fast as possible.
</li>

I borrowed all of my assests from the internet.
