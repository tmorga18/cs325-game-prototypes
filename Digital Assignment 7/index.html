<h2>Shut the box... using cards!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    Roll the die and flip over your cards based on the sum of the die. Once you flips them all over, you win!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
    No theme since this is a card game.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
    Input is direct where the player clicks on buttons and cards to interact with them.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
    I want the player to have a relaxing time just thinking about which cards to flip.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
    The player can click on a button to roll 2 die and then their sum will be shown. Then, the player must flip over their cards so that the total value of their cards matches the sum of the die. They will continue this pattern until they flip over all of their cards.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>   
    Allow the player to actually be able to finish one game.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
    There are a few buttons that the player can press, along with the cards which they can click on. There are a few text fields which will show the player some messages along with some of the sums and totals.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
    This game has no setting or premise since it is a card game.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
    Again, this game has no story because it is a card game.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
    Card games typically target older audiences but can probably be targeted towards anyone 18+.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
    A typical game only takes a few minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
    There are no specific strategies yet.
