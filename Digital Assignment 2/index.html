<h2>Revenge on the Evil Twin</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Your evil twin is out to get you... RUN!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Revenge story (your evil twins wants to get revenge on you)
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used keyboard keys (W, A, S, and D for up, left, down, and right). The buildings spawn in different positions each game. The evil twin runs in semi random ways to get to you. This is an action game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the players to experience an adrenaline rush trying to get away from the evil twin who gets faster over time. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
    
The player can only move in 4 directions using the keyboard. The core mechanic is just movement and AI that is chasing you. The player is encouraged to use the buildings as cover, which will buy them more time. I planned to have more evil twins chasing you and more places to hide behind but I did not have enough time/skill.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating just basic movement and AI pathfinding.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
I like how I generate the building randomly and that the AI has a slightly different chasing pattern than most games. I also like how he speeds up over time.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
    
The setting of the game is just in a small town where you live. I downloaded most of the sprites from Deviant Art where some people worked on Pokemon-like buildings.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
If the game has a story (or you envision a story for the full game), summarize it in a paragraph. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
    
When you were born, you had a twin. As you grew up with him, he was always mean to you and other children. As a result, you got more attention and had more friends. This just made him meaner and meaner. You always thought that he was evil on the inside. Maybe he was even possessed? You moved away from him but he's been looking for you to get revenge. And now he's found you!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who enjoys a fast paced game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
About 30 seconds to a minute.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Good movement controls and good use of cover.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
    I borrowed a lot of my code from the examples on the Phaser website and from the Phaser documentation.
